   CSBS can restore an ECS to the latest backup point in time when the ECS has not been affected by hacker attacks and viruses.

-  Accidental deletion

   CSBS can restore an ECS to the backup point in time prior to accidental deletion.

-  Application update errors

   CSBS can restore an ECS to the backup point in time prior to application update.
