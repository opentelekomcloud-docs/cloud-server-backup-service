How to Access CSBS
==================

Web-based service management platforms, including HTTPS-based application programming interfaces (APIs) and the management console, are provided for you to access the CSBS service.

-  APIs

   Use this access method if you are required to integrate the ECSs on the cloud service platform into a third-party system for secondary development. For detailed operations, see the *Cloud Server Backup Service API Reference*.

-  Management console

   Use this access method if you do not need secondary development. If you already have a cloud service account, log in to the management console and click **Cloud Server Backup Service** on the homepage.
