Constraints and Limitations
===========================

Note the following constraints and limitations about CSBS:

-  An ECS can be associated with only one backup policy.
-  Shared EVS disks in ECSs can be backed up.
-  CSBS supports crash-consistent backup of EVS disks on an ECS but not application-consistent backup of them.
-  CSBS does not support consistent backup of multiple ECSs.
-  CSBS supports backup and restoration of all EVS disks as a whole instead of part of the EVS disks on an ECS. In addition, CSBS does not support file- or directory-level restoration.
-  You are not advised to back up an ECS whose capacity exceeds 4 TB.
-  Servers or disks at the disaster recovery (DR) site can be restored only when DR protection is disabled for servers deployed with Storage Disaster Recovery Service.
