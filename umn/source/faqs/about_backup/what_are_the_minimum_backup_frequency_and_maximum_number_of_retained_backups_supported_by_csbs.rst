What Are the Minimum Backup Frequency and Maximum Number of Retained Backups Supported by CSBS?
===============================================================================================

The minimum frequency for policy-driven backup is once per hour. Manual backup can be performed at any frequency.

You can manually set the backup time (accurate to minute) in a backup policy. The backup interval must be not shorter than 1 hour.

There is no upper limit on the maximum number of retained backups. You can set it as needed.
