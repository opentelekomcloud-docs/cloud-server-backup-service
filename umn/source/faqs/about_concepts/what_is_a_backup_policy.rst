What Is a Backup Policy?
========================

A backup policy is a set of rules for backing up data, including the policy name, policy status, execution time of backup jobs, backup period, and retention rules. The retention rules specify the retention duration and number of retained backups. After an ECS is associated with a backup policy, it can be automatically backed up according to the backup policy.
