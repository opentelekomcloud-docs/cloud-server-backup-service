What Is CSBS?
=============

CSBS backs up an entire ECS. It uses the consistent backup data of multiple EVS disks to restore the service data of an ECS. CSBS ensures data security and service continuity.

CSBS provides crash-consistent backup of multiple EVS disks to ensure that these EVS disks are backed up at the same time. Different from application-consistent backup, crash-consistent backup does not freeze applications and file systems and does not include memory data.
